Description:
I don't know for sure that something like this does not already exist in Vim, but if it does, I can't find it.

I recall Cream having this kind of functionallity mapped to <F6>,
so to maintain consistency I've kept the convention.

This uses the current value of &cms / &commentstring to comment and uncomment code.
It works for ranges selected in Visual mode, or for the current line in all modes.
NB. Comment strings may not include '@' or '+'
(I don't know of any languages that use these characters for comments).

Help:
Use <F6> to comment, and <S-F6> to uncomment
